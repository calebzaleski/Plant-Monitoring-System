# Arduino Plant Project

Hello everyone, my name is **Caleb** and this is my own personal plant monitoring system so it is very "janky". Very Basic coding head-knowledge is required to understand this project.


Help would be greatly appreciated and is always welcome. You can reach me at [zPiProjects Email](mailto:zPiProjects@gmail.com)

Pre-requisites:


1. Arduino IDE
https://www.arduino.cc

2. Raspberry Pi Pico 1 or 2, W or WH OR an Arduino . They are cheep on amazon like $10. I used a Pico W and recommend a WH model so you can plug and play. https://a.co/d/4aHICb4 ("H" means it has headers pre soldered on)

3. Solder-less Breadboard is easer to start this project with but both can be used.

4. Wires for the breadboard.

5. Soil Sensor. I started off with these: https://a.co/d/iOuQ6Mj each one works for about a week but then oxidizes, DO NOT BUY FOR LONG TERM USE. A CORROSION RESISTANT SENSOR IS A MUST: https://a.co/d/7zGgF1j

OPTIONAL. I used a Submersible 3V DC Water Pump - 1 Meter Vertical Type: https://www.adafruit.com/product/4547 to water my plant when it gets low. (Coming soon)

OPTIONAL. Any Raspberry Pi that can run a MQTT server Github link: https://github.com/eclipse-mosquitto/mosquitto 

Raspberry Pi Zero
Raspberry Pi Zero W
Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
Raspberry Pi 1
Raspberry Pi 2
Raspberry Pi 3
Raspberry Pi 4
Raspberry Pi 400

Note: Please note that I am assuming that you are powering your Pi's or Arduino's with sufficient power. If you don't (which I have experienced plenty of hair pulling hours due to) IT WILL NOT RUN CORRECTLY.
